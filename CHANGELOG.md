# Changelog

All notable changes to MathQuest. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
The app version lives in `js/version.js` (and the service-worker cache name); bumping it
ships a self-update to every installed device.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-06 — "The Legit Update"
### Added
- **Common Core alignment** — every skill is tagged with its CCSS standard, shown in the
  lesson header and the Grown-ups dashboard (`js/curriculum/standards.js`).
- **Placement quiz** in onboarding to find the right starting grade.
- **Spaced review** — mastered skills resurface for a quick refresh before they fade.
- **Self-updating PWA** — installed apps detect new versions and offer a one-tap update;
  a "What's New" sheet summarizes each release.
- **New visual manipulatives**: percent bars, ratio tape diagrams, 3-D volume boxes, dot plots.
- **Adaptive difficulty**, **daily goals**, streak milestones, and session accuracy summaries.
### Changed
- Worked solutions re-show the picture and **bold** the key step; ALL-CAPS replaced with bold.
### Accessibility
- Visible focus rings, pinch-zoom re-enabled, color-blind-safe ✓/✗ answer states,
  keyboard-navigable tabs, ARIA on the XP bar, dark-theme legibility fixes.
### Fixed
- Fraction keypad now has a working space key (mixed-number answers were unenterable).
- Hardened the practice session against double-award / double-render edge cases.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-06 — "Hello, MathQuest!"
### Added
- First release: 60 lessons across grades 3–6, a deterministic teaching engine with
  step-by-step solutions and a hint ladder, 75 word problems, 36 badges, a shop, 11 pets,
  a friendly mascot, sound, confetti, a parent dashboard, and offline PWA support.
